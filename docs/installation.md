# Installation

As a standard WordPress plugin, installation is the same as most other plugins. This can be done adding the plugin as a zip file, or by using Composer.

Requires PHP 7.0 or later.

## Zip

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cedaro/satispress/releases/latest) from GitHub (use the asset named `satispress-{version}.zip`).
2. Go to the _Plugins &rarr; Add New_ screen in your WordPress admin panel and click the __Upload Plugin__ button at the top.
3. Upload the zipped archive.
4. Click the __Activate Plugin__ link after installation completes.

## Composer

SatisPress is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/cedaro/satispress), so it can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require cedaro/satispress
```
