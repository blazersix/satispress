# Installation

As a standard WordPress plugin, installation is the same as most other plugins. This can be done adding the plugin as a zip file, or by using Composer.

Requires PHP 7.0 or later.

## Zip

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/blazersix/satispress/archive/master.zip) from GitHub.
2. Go to the _Plugins &rarr; Add New_ screen in your WordPress admin panel and click the __Upload__ tab at the top.
3. Upload the zipped archive.
4. Click the __Activate Plugin__ link after installation completes.

## Composer

SatisPress is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/blazersix/satispress), so it can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require blazersix/satispress
```
